## Background on the "weighted on-base average"

A longstanding tradition in empirical Bayes research is to include an
analysis of batting averages using data from Major League Baseball
(see, for example, [@BrownBaseball; @JiangZhangBaseball;
@GuKoenkerBaseball]). Until recently, batting averages were the most
important measurement of a hitter's performance, with the prestigious
yearly "batting title" going to the hitter with the highest
average. However, with the rise of baseball analytics, metrics that
better correlate to teams' overall run production have become
increasingly preferred.  One such metric is wOBA ("weighted on-base
average"), which is both an excellent measure of a hitter's offensive
production and, unlike competing metrics such as MLB's xwOBA
[@xwoba] or Baseball Prospectus's DRC+ [@drcplus], can be
calculated using publicly available data and methods.

Initially proposed by [@Tango], wOBA assigns values ("weights") to
hitting outcomes according to how much the outcome contributes on
average to run production. For example, while batting average treats
singles identically to home runs, wOBA gives a hitter more than twice
as much credit for a home run. (*Note:* Weights are updated from year
to year, but wOBA weights for singles have remained near 0.9 for the
last several decades, while weights for home runs have hovered
around 2.0 [@fgguts].)
